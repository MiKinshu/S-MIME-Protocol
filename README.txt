Code by Prateek Mishra, IIT2018199 IIIT-Allahabad.
In this code I have implemented S/MIME mail protocol using python. This was given to me as an Assignment in the network security course at IIIT-Allahabad.
To run this code, follow these steps:
1. Install the necessary dependencies using pip or pip3
2. Run python3 KeyGenerator.py to generate the public and private keys for Alice and Bob.
3. Run python3 Server.py in bash terminal
4. In a different terminal run python3 Sender.py
5. Again in a different terminal run python3 Reciever.py
6. Type in the required email in the sender terminal.
7. Observe the changes in the server and the reciever terminal.
